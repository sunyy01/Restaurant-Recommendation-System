# Resturant Recommendation System -- Vancouver 
## project_58
Brief project description:
- This is a restaurant recommendation system containing Vancouver restaurant
information.
- The database will collect comprehensive information about the restaurants in
Vancouver, including the name/address/category of the restaurants, all the
features, the rating(0-5 stars) and diverse dish styles.
- The site aims to provide dining recommendations and offer a most fair
platform for customers to share their experience (about features) and
feedback (rating scale up to 5), as well as for business(restaurants) owners to
publish the most updated information, such as price range and features.
- If a user search for a specific dish type/feature (i.e. Chinese dish/pet-friendly),
the application would pop out a list of restaurant recommendations based on
its rating score.
